# Antigravity Examples

This repository serves as a playground for experiments and examples using the **Antigravity IDE**.

## About Antigravity

**Google Antigravity** is an AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE) designed with an "agent-first" approach. It allows developers to delegate complex coding tasks to autonomous AI agents powered by Gemini 3 Pro.

Key features include:
- **Agent-First Paradigm**: Agents operate with autonomy to plan, execute, and verify tasks.
- **Two Primary Views**: Editor view for coding and Manager view for orchestrating agents.
- **Verifiable Artifacts**: Agents generate transparent audit trails of their work.
